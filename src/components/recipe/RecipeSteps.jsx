                <li>Melt the butter, then let it cool down.</li>
                <li>Mix dry ingredients together: flour, baking powder, instant pudding.</li>
                <li>Separate egg yolks from egg whites.</li>
                <li>Beat egg yolks with xylitol/regular sugar and vanilla sugar along with a pinch of salt (about 4 minutes on low speed in a Thermomix), add milk, pour in the melted butter, and mix for another 10 seconds on the lowest speed until a smooth mixture forms.</li>
                <li><b>Beat egg whites until stiff,</b> VERY IMPORTANT!</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture of egg yolks into the bowl with dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.</li>
                <li><b>Gently</b> fold in the beaten egg whites.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Bake for 50 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius, top and bottom heat mode in oven.</p>
            <p>After 50 minutes, insert a wooden stick and check if it's ready (it should be slightly moist).
            Open the oven door and leave for 10 minutes.
            <br/>Then let it cool.</p>
